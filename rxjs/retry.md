The RxJS `retry` operator is used to automatically resubscribe to an Observable stream when it encounters an error. It takes an optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of times to retry before giving up.Internally, `retry` subscribes to the source Observable and forwards all emitted values to the subscriber. If an error occurs, `retry` will resubscribe to the source Observable and continue to do so until either the maximum number of retries is reached or the source Observable completes successfully. 

If the maximum number of retries is reached and the source Observable still emits an error, the error will be forwarded to the subscriber and the Observable will complete. 

Overall, `retry` simplifies error handling in RxJS by automatically retrying failed Observables, reducing the need for manual error handling and resubscription logic.
