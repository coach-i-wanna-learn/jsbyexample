webpack SplitChunksPlugin 的原理是什么，举例说明
The SplitChunksPlugin in Webpack is used to split chunks into smaller chunks that can be shared between multiple entry points. This can help reduce duplication and improve caching.

The plugin works by analyzing the dependency graph of the modules in the compilation and identifying modules that are used in multiple entry points. It then creates new chunks that contain these shared modules and updates the entry points to use these new chunks instead of the original ones.

For example, if you have two entry points that both use the same library, the SplitChunksPlugin can create a new chunk that contains the library and make both entry points use this new chunk instead of duplicating the library code in each entry point.

You can configure the SplitChunksPlugin using various options, such as minSize and maxAsyncRequests, to control how the chunks are split. The plugin also supports cache groups, which allow you to group modules together based on certain criteria and create separate chunks for each group.

You can find the implementation of the SplitChunksPlugin in the SplitChunksPlugin.js file in the webpack/lib/optimize directory of the Webpack source code.

The SplitChunksPlugin is a plugin in Webpack that is used to split chunks into smaller chunks that can be shared between multiple entry points. This can help reduce duplication and improve caching.

The plugin works by analyzing the dependency graph of the modules in the compilation and identifying modules that are used in multiple entry points. It then creates new chunks that contain these shared modules and updates the entry points to use these new chunks instead of the original ones.

The SplitChunksPlugin can be configured using various options, such as minSize and maxAsyncRequests, to control how the chunks are split. The plugin also supports cache groups, which allow you to group modules together based on certain criteria and create separate chunks for each group.

The code in SplitChunksPlugin.js defines various types and interfaces used by the plugin, as well as the logic for splitting chunks. The splitChunks function is the main entry point for the plugin and is responsible for creating new chunks based on the configuration options and cache groups.

The splitChunks function first creates a map of all the chunks in the compilation and their corresponding modules. It then iterates over each cache group and applies the cache group's configuration options to the chunks and modules. If a chunk satisfies the cache group's criteria, a new chunk is created and the modules are moved to the new chunk.

The splitChunks function also takes into account various size limits and thresholds when creating new chunks. For example, if a chunk is smaller than the minSize option, it will not be split. Similarly, if a chunk is larger than the maxInitialSize option, it will not be split further.

Overall, the SplitChunksPlugin is a powerful tool for optimizing the performance of your Webpack builds by reducing duplication and improving caching.
