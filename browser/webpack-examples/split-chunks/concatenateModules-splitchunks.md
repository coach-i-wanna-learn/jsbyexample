Based on the code you provided, the SplitChunksPlugin in Webpack does not directly affect the concatenateModules optimization.

The SplitChunksPlugin is responsible for splitting chunks into smaller chunks to improve caching and reduce duplication. It does this by analyzing the dependencies between modules and creating new chunks based on certain criteria, such as the size of the chunk or the number of chunks that depend on a module.

On the other hand, concatenateModules is an optimization that combines modules into a single module to reduce the size of the bundle and improve performance. This optimization is performed by the ModuleConcatenationPlugin.

While the two optimizations are related in that they both aim to reduce duplication and improve performance, they operate at different levels of the build process and do not directly affect each other.

That being said, it is possible that the SplitChunksPlugin could indirectly affect the concatenateModules optimization if it changes the structure of the chunks in a way that makes it more difficult to combine modules. However, this would depend on the specific configuration of the SplitChunksPlugin and the modules being used in the build.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.


ES6模块才可以被合并。模块合并 发生在 代码分离 之后。
