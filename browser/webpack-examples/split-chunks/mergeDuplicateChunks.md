To answer your question, mergeDuplicateChunks is a Webpack optimization that merges chunks with the same content. This optimization is useful in scenarios where multiple entry points or modules import the same code, resulting in duplicated chunks.

For example, let's say we have two entry points in our Webpack configuration, entry1.js and entry2.js, both of which import the same module sharedModule.js. When Webpack bundles these entry points, it will create two separate chunks for sharedModule.js, resulting in duplicated code.

To solve this issue, we can use the mergeDuplicateChunks optimization. This optimization will detect the duplicated chunks and merge them into a single chunk, reducing the overall bundle size.

To enable this optimization in your Webpack configuration, you can add the following code:

// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  optimization: {
    mergeDuplicateChunks: true
  }
};
This will enable the mergeDuplicateChunks optimization for your Webpack build.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
