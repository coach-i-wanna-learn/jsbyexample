如何最大程度利用 Chrome's code caching
To maximize the use of Chrome's code caching, there are a few things you can do:

Use a build tool like Webpack or Rollup to bundle your code into a single file. This will reduce the number of requests made to the server and allow Chrome to cache the entire application code.

Use long-term caching by adding a unique hash to the filename of your bundled code. This will ensure that when you make changes to your code, the browser will download the new version instead of using the cached version.

Use HTTP caching headers to control how long the browser should cache your code. You can set the Cache-Control header to specify the maximum age of the cached resource. For example, you can set it to max-age=31536000 to cache the resource for one year.

Use service workers to cache your application shell and other critical resources. This will allow your application to load faster and be available offline.

In terms of the code itself, there are a few things you can do to optimize for caching:

Minimize the size of your code by removing unnecessary whitespace and comments.

Use tree shaking to remove unused code from your application.

Use code splitting to split your application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.

Here's an example of how you can use Webpack to bundle your code and add a hash to the filename:

// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
This configuration will generate a file with a unique hash in the filename, which will allow the browser to cache the file until the hash changes.
