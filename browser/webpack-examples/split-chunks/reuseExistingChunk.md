webpack reuseExistingChunk 是否会导致打包的 js 代码的性能劣化
Based on the provided code, there is not enough context to determine if webpack's reuseExistingChunk option will cause a performance degradation in the resulting JavaScript code.

However, in general, reuseExistingChunk is a feature that allows webpack to reuse existing chunks instead of creating new ones. This can lead to a smaller bundle size and faster build times.

That being said, there are some potential downsides to using this feature. For example, if the reused chunk is larger than necessary, it could lead to increased memory usage and slower runtime performance. Additionally, if the reused chunk is not optimized for the specific use case, it could lead to suboptimal performance.

To determine if reuseExistingChunk is causing a performance degradation in your specific use case, you should analyze the resulting JavaScript code and measure its performance. You can use tools like Chrome DevTools or Lighthouse to help with this analysis.

If you want to learn more about reuseExistingChunk and how it works, you can refer to the official webpack documentation: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#splitchunksreuseexistingchunk.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
