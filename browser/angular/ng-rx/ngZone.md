# when we should use ngZone

To answer your question, NgZone is a service provided by Angular that helps manage the execution of asynchronous tasks outside of the Angular zone.

The Angular zone is a mechanism that tracks the state of asynchronous tasks and updates the view when necessary. When a task is executed outside of the Angular zone, Angular may not be aware of the changes and may not update the view accordingly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

NgZone provides a way to explicitly run code outside of the Angular zone. This can be useful when working with third-party libraries or APIs that may not be aware of the Angular zone.

You should use NgZone when you need to run code outside of the Angular zone and want to ensure that Angular is aware of any changes that may occur.

Here's an example of how to use NgZone in your code:


import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <button (click)="runOutsideAngular()">Run outside Angular</button>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}

  runOutsideAngular() {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      // Code to run outside of Angular zone
    });
  }
}
In this example, we're using NgZone to run some code outside of the Angular zone when the button is clicked.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
